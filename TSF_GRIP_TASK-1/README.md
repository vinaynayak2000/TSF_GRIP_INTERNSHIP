## Predicting the scores
Business Problem: Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours using Supervised ML

# Steps followed
1. Import required libraries and create a dataframe of the url
2. Identify feature and target variables, perform data cleaning by removing information that is not relevant to our study, implement feature engineering
3. Perform Exploratory Data analysis on the cleaned data using correlation to derive insights
4. Model is then trained on training data using Simple Linear Regression Algorithm, model performance evaluated on testing data
5. Results verified with the insights
